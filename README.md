# Student Performance

This Python project visualizes and queries data of a university's CSV database.

## Introduction

This project was an assignment I had to work on when I applied for an internship. So, I had to _**create a program that makes querying the CSV data easier, along with visualization with matplotlib**_.

## Settings It Up

First, download the GitHub repo into a single directory. Second, run the `run-steps.py` Python file. This will install and upgrade the necessary packages and tools required to run this project.

**Pandas** is used for data analysis. **Matplotlib** is used for data visualization. **Numpy** is used for the algorithms.

## Running the Program

Run the `main.py` file and you get 8 options. You should enter the option number, i.e. 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8.

Then, you get an input to ask for some details. Enter the details from the respective CSV file. **Example:** If it's asking for an employee ID, go to the `Employees` CSV file and get any employee ID. Same for any other details it asks.

1) **Employee Information** - Enter the employee ID and you get details about that employee.
2) **Number of Employees in a Department** - Enter the department ID and you get the number of employees in that department.
3) **Department Information** - Enter the department ID and you get details about that department.
4) **Student Counseling Information** - Enter the student ID and you get details about that counseling session.
5) **Student Performance** - Enter the student ID, semester, and paper ID. You get their overall performance. Semester and paper ID is _**optional**_.
6) **Student Performance (Bar Chart)** - Enter the student ID and the semester. You get the bar chart of their overall performance in that semester.
7) **Compare Students in a Semester (Bar Chart)** - Enter the first student ID, second student ID, and the semester. You get the bar chart of the both the students' overall performance in that semester.
8) **Compare Semesters of a Student (Bar Chart)** - Enter the student ID, first semester, and second semester. You get the bar chart of the student's overall performance in both the semesters.
