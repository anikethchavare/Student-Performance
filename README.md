# Student Performance

This Python program visualizes and queries data of a university's CSV database.

## Introduction

This project was a technical assignment for a "Software Developer" internship. I had to create a program that makes querying the CSV data easier, along with visualization with `matplotlib`.

## Settings It Up

### 1) Downloading the Files

Firstly, download the above files and store it in a single directory.

### 2) Installing the Python Modules

You should download Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy. You can use the following commands:

`pip install pandas` <br/>
`pip install matplotlib` <br/>
`pip install numpy` <br/>

## Running the Program

Run the `main.py` file and you get 8 options. You can then enter the option number, i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.

You then get an input to ask for some details. Go ahead and enter the details from the respective CSV file. **Example:** If it's asking for a employee ID, just go to the `Employees` CSV file and get any employee ID. Same for any other details it asks.

1) **Employee Information** - Enter the employee ID and you get details about that employee.
2) **Department Information** - Enter the department ID and you get details about that department.
3) **Student Counselling Information** - Enter the student ID and you get details about that session.
4) **Student Performance** - Enter the student ID and you get his overall performance.
5) **Number of Employees in a Department** - Enter the department ID and you get the number of employees in that department.
6) **Bar Chart of a Student in a Semester (Visualization)** - Enter the student ID and the semester. You get the bar diagram of the student's marks in the given semester.
7) **Compare 2 Semesters of a Student (Visualization)** - Enter the student ID, the first semester, and the second semester. It compares the two semesters and gives you a bar diagram of both the semester's marks.
8) **Compare 2 Students in a Semester (Visualization)** - Enter the two student IDs and the semester you want to compare them in. It compares the two students in the given semester and displays a bar diagram.
